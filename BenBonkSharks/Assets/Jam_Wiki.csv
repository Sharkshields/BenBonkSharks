A brief information about 2729b.|...from the presented plant species, we can judge that the biosphere of the southern hemisphere roughly corresponds to the Paleozoic era of Earth. Although this hemisphere should be ideal for settlement, predicted absence of coal, oil and gas basins reduces the role of a hypothetical colony to ore mining and setting up an earth-like agro-complex...
A popular opinion.|When I reached the river bank, I had an epiphany, and understood how to harness the powers of the flowing water. But the villagers laughed at me when I returned and asked them to collect oars and millstones to set them on the bank. So I did not build the cereal grinding device.
Western lizards.|The Union of Iron Cities is an advanced industrial lizard state stretching along the southernmost latitudes of the continent, with no other settlements or cities on the planet.
A note about trees.|It's strange that the southern trees look so simple, but the trees here, though shorter, have tricky leaves. If you cut them down, their trunk would be completely uneven, in circles. Another deal whatsoever are the trees of my homeland, where the whole trunk is clear and useful in construction.
The Ermanrok base.|The Ermanrock Lizard Base is an elaborate heated structure of machines and sheets of iron, built in the field and hastily. For the most part, it is a house surrounded by moats, and founded solely for survival and defense in harsh weather conditions of the northern territory of the Cat State, near the Ice Palace of the town of Izh-Inta.
Small cat settlement.|The Shudya settlement was founded by the ancient Shudya clan and is the southernmost in the United Cat Tribes. Surrounded by rare woods, the cozy farming village is nestled near the banks of the Vyatka River. Behind the village are acres of farm fields with a variety of crops. The fields are irrigated thanks to an intricate canal system that the locals have extended in all directions from the river.
Protocol-Z37.|Protocol-Z37: I, Julios Ortnicki, scout of the third cohort of Aliev, conducted a survey of Fort G-3, called "Ice Palace" by the locals. Based on local accounts and, more importantly, spectral analysis, we can conclude that the heating takes place thanks to the location of hot springs and cavity networks in the walls.
Protocol-Z39.|Protocol-Z39: I am Bucellaria of "TDC", my name is Ulrich Stormbringer. After talking to the prisoners, I found out that Fort G-3, referred to locally as the "Ice Palace", was built by the so-called "first ones". According to the legends they possessed magic, but with barely any analysis it was clear that some form of advanced technology was used to build it, from which I conclude that some locals may possess them or the territory contains means of production beyond the primitives' grasp.
A cats' trade center.|Vyatskk, a feline settlement, is larger than the neighboring Shudya. It is a rich trading town, surrounded by woods and standing on the Vyatka River. The main government building, homes of local residents, and a shaman's temple are located behind tall wooden palisades. The temple became the religious center for all inhabitants of the Association of Cat Tribes.
Territory Assimilation Committee.,"TDC" - Territory Development Committee - The goals of this organization include, in addition to initial exploration and consolidation, the search for valuable resources ranging from minerals to the local population.
3rd cohort composition.|Third cohort of aliev serves the "TDC" and includes: 3 Themes of Cataphractarii, 6 Themes of Trapezit. So does the seventh cohort of stratiots, which include: 4 Themes of Scutatii, 6 Themes of Psil and approximately 40 associations of Bucellarii.
